Business on Basics
------------------

IDE for a Database Front-end / Business Process Management Application, with template marketplace

*If you know of a disucssion platform, or project with the same goals, please share your inputs on the Wiki or Issues pages on github.*

This projecct is intended to provide anyone with a business idea, access to an easy-to-use "drag-and-drop" environment with a library for common business processes.

Think of it as a generic, light-weight CRM and BPM with templates for most any business, usable out of the box. The idea is that, if you see a product, or a market, you can draw your idea, and immediately employ people to do the work, with little or no need to know much about the finer subtleties about running a business - after all, those tasks that can not be automated by computer, should be able to be automatically outsourced to someone who is an expert in the field.

A big idea to put in here would be that of "open-accounting" - open as in open source, as well as a common API to exchange market and pricing information in.

It might someday merge into an existing CRM or software development platform - or who knows, perhaps these already exist and I have not been looking hard enough. My current favourites are Joget and Adempiere.

Anyone is free to contribute. The core source, API's and documentation will always be free.

Want to start Groupon? Easy, if you know what you're doing, you can do all the work in a week (sorry guys)

Want to replace the need for SAP contractors in your company? May take you a few weeks.

I sincerely thought that we'd have this by now. 

Sure, the industrial revolution put a lot of people out of work - but it also forced people to do better things with their time. Or gave them the freedom to pursue their dreams.
